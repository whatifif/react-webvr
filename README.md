### Project

This project is to demonstrate the WebVR using aframe and react.

This project is inspired by [RSpace/aframe-meetup-example](https://github.com/rspace/aframe-meetup-example).

This project is modified from [cloudmu/react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/cloudmu/react-redux-starter-kit).

This project can be deployed to Heroku.



### Original-Overview

This is yet another React and Redux based web application starter kit. However, this one attempts to go beyond the typical simple boilerplates, by showcasing several great technologies (such as [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux), [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router), [Fixed-Data-Table](https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), [Babel](http://babeljs.io), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io)) and [JWT](https://jwt.io)) used together to develop a more complex web application, with features such as authentication, navigation, asynchronous data fetching, error handling, caching and pagination, etc.

### Install and Run the Dev Server

```
npm install
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:3000

### Build and Run the Production Server
